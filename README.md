From my Analysis, here are some of the key findings;

I found that there are currently 1,072 unicorn companies globally with a combine valuation of 3.7 trillion USD. Funding for unicorn companies have exploded in recent years, peaking in 2021 at $154bn funding. Sequoia Capital. Accrel, Softbank Group are the dominant investors in the space.

Globally, the most valued unicorn companies are; 
- ByteDance
- SHEIN
- SpaceX
- Stripe
- Klarna

The North American region has the largest share of unicorn companies, with the USA currently haaving over 561 companies, with SpaceX ($100bn valuation) being the higest valued in the country. In Asia, as expected, China has the second highest number of unicorn companies, 173 companies, with the highest valued being the parent company of TikTok - ByteDance, at a $180bn valuation.

In terms of industry, the Fintech sector has the highest valuation, followed by Internet software, e-commerce, Artificial intelligence and others. It takes on average, 7 years for a company to attain a unicorn status, however, some companies scale massively within their first 2-3 years of establishment. Companies like Rohlik -2years. FTX, OPay, ScalaPay, Wave, all attained unicorn status in just a year.

Overall, this analysis shed light into the industries, countries and sectors that possess the highest number of unicorn companies. The sharp decline in funding for Unicorn companies, is a testament to the current tightening monetary policy globally.
